**Aislin Diamant** is a gentleman thief and a shapeshifter who uses their abilities to steal jewels and artifacts. They also occasionally live with [Ember](#) as a cat named Trick. Because of their species, they would be outshun if they were found out. So they’ve learned to keep people at a distance without losing their trust as best as they possibly can.

*[shapeshifter]: This is some little info about the thing.

## Personality

They are a outgoing and charming person, usually using their charm to get their way into and out of situations. They tend to analyze wherever they are to make sure they can escape if needed, even if they trust the person who brought them there. Although when its time for actions, they can sometimes be hasty and scatterbrained.

They are very imaginative and talkative as well, and like to tease whoever they're with for fun. They tend to start talking more if they're uncomfortable or aren't interested in the current conversation. But they can also get very quiet at times if they’re in their head or if they're intimidated.

## Biography
### Early Life

Aislin was born from the infamous shapeshifter experiment that happened from 2025 to 2030. Their mother was selected and injected with a gene commonly found in domesticated animals. A year later most of the world had flooded, and their mother fled with other mothers and children of the experiment to a small island not too far from the city.

The parents tried their best to provide food for everyone, but after a few years, they had to start going to the city for resources. This left the mothers absent from the older kids, as they tried to take care of the youngest. 

One of the older kids, Estrella, tended to hang around Aislin a lot. They would play pretend and make plans to save their island together. When they were teenagers, Estrella was taken away from the island without a word. This left Aislin sad and confused, but also determined to find out what happened to her from her mouth.

When Aislin got older, they realized how much the mothers were struggling to take care of some of the younger kids. Wanting to do something to help and take stress off of the mothers and kids, they started shapeshifting and stealing things from the city with a gentleman thief persona, inspired by much of the pretend they did with Estrella. They enjoyed playing and toying with the police, and the recognition and praise they got on the island. 

### Present Day

After a few months of building their thief identity, a new cop was assigned to the area they usually steal from. Aislin felt they were different than usual cops— engaging with their banter and seeing threw a lot of their plays. They started to seek out interactions with this specific cop, to see how they would respond.

After an especially hard chase, it was getting too dark to go back to their island. They decided to shift into a cat to take a nap in a secure area until they could get back. By the time they woke up, someone had found them and brought them in their house. Concinidently, it ended up being the new cop, Ember.

Ember continued to allow Aislin (Who she has nicknamed 'Trick') to sleep and occasionally eat at her house. Despite her hospitality, Aislin tries not to overstay their welcome as they still feel a little guilty about the situation.

Aislin admires Ember's hospitality and kindness. Their relationship is extremely complicated, with Ember being kind and affectionate towards them when they’re transformed into a cat and as their rival when they are untransformed. Despite that, they still do care for Ember and find their quarrels fun and exciting— they also are a little interested in her romantically.
