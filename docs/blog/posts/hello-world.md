# Welcome to Shiftpedia!


Welcome to my very cool original character based documentation. This post is to answer a few questions and just generally introduce this wiki-documentation.

<!-- more -->

## What is Shiftpedia?

*Shiftpedia* is a documentation for my own original story, Shiftbreaker. The site itself is built using [MkDocs, with the Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) It holds all characters, artwork, literatures, and the lore itself. It also has any resources I find about character creation and any other fun things I'd like to share!

## Why MkDocs?

I have my characters stored in a billion different sites and even jumbled in a google drive. And I do really like all of those options, but I wanted something simple that I had most control over that people could still view. So, website! I did think about making all the pages myself with just HTML and CSS, but I decided it would be better if I used some type of framework or generator. And after experimenting with a few, Material ended up being the easiest! 

## How do I make something like this?

I'm planning on eventually explaining how I did this— but if you want to try yourself, [this youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/Q-YA_dA8C20?si=IUBkTlf_-wofKidY) and the [Material docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) are a great way to get started! Feel free to ask anything in the comments as well if you have any questions on how I did a specific thing.
