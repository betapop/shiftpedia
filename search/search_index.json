A year later most of the world had flooded, and their mother fled with other mothers and children of the experiment to a small island not too far from the city.</p> <p>The parents tried their best to provide food for everyone, but after a few years, they had to start going to the city for resources. This left the mothers absent from the older kids, as they tried to take care of the youngest. </p> <p>One of the older kids, Estrella, tended to hang around Aislin a lot. They would play pretend and make plans to save their island together. When they were teenagers, Estrella was taken away from the island without a word. This left Aislin sad and confused, but also determined to find out what happened to her from her mouth.</p> <p>When Aislin got older, they realized how much the mothers were struggling to take care of some of the younger kids. Wanting to do something to help and take stress off of the mothers and kids, they started shapeshifting and stealing things from the city with a gentleman thief persona, inspired by much of the pretend they did with Estrella. They enjoyed playing and toying with the police, and the recognition and praise they got on the island. </p>"},{"location":"Characters/aislin-diamant/#present-day","title":"Present Day","text":"<p>After a few months of building their thief identity, a new cop was assigned to the area they usually steal from.

They decided to shift into a cat to take a nap in a secure area until they could get back. By the time they woke up, someone had found them and brought them in their house. Concinidently, it ended up being the new cop, Ember.</p> <p>Ember continued to allow Aislin (Who she has nicknamed 'Trick') to sleep and occasionally eat at her house.
